# What's the purpose of this course?

.pull-left[
### Introduce empirical research

- **STATISTICS**
  - Field concerned with collecting and analyzing data  
  - Focused on variation and uncertainty

- **THE RESEARCH PROCESS**  
  - Roots in the scientific project  
  - From question to findings  
  - Evaluating research

### Support University mission

- Research is the best of what we do

- Asking and answering questions is still a radical act!

- Scientific inquiry *can* support and strengthen free-thinking society

# Basement Tapes
### In-class discussion

1. What theory motivates Frantzâ€™s study? Identify the key cause and the outcome he seeks to explain.  
2. What did Frantz know from prior studies, and why were those findings seen as incomplete or insufficient?  
3. How does Frantz test his core hypothesis? Be specific about the design of his elaborate study.  
4. What do his results show? What are we to make of the findings? 

For reference: [podcast](https://www.pushkin.fm/podcasts/revisionist-history/the-basement-tapes#play) (S2E10) and [study results](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1161/01.atv.9.1.129)

# Get to know the course

- Let's visit the [living course syllabus](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1V5JLruDU9m9_eSnQqXQZ5-yDZCGlc9GZOQsVNcf3C7Q/edit?usp=sharing)

- Expectations for class  
  - We begin on time  
  - Take notes and ask questions  
  - Leave Slacks, chats, etc. behind

- Outside of class  
  - Do the reading  
  - Give yourself time to do assignments  
  - Be in touch!

### Bacon's new empiricism

- Knowledge through observation and experimentation

- Inductive reasoning
  - Move from specific to general 
  - Probabilistic claims    
  - Conclusions open to new evidence
  
- Progress by rejecting bad ideas

- Study "effects of causes"
  - Exposure variable: cause, $X$
  - Outcome variable: effect, $Y$

- Theory: what we *think* we know about $X \rightarrow Y$

- Hypotheses: observable implications of theory

.panel[.panel-name[Study]

- Research design
  - *Experiment (RCT)*: the researcher exposes units to different values of treatment at random.    
  - *Observational*: the researcher observes and records values of the variables as they are.  

- Data collection  

- Statistical analysis  
  - Characterize the relationship  
  - Is it systematic? 

]

.panel[.panel-name[Report]

- Answer your question given the analysis

- Consider the validity of your conclusion  
  - Internal validity: have you ruled out alternative explanations and sources of bias?  
  - External validity: do the results generalize to other cases, places, treatments, and outcomes?

- What do your findings mean for extant theory?
